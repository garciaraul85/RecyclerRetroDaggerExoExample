# HomeAway code challenge

# How to build it:
Just run it directly from Android Studio

# Libraries used:
This project uses Glide for image loading, Dagger2 for DI, Android Architecture libs for MVVM, Async Tasks to cache and retrieve data,
Retrofit and RXAndroid for network calls, Sugar for DB.

# To improve:
Switch Sugar with ROOM, switch Async tasks for Gsm.Task, create a repository layer between the ViewModel and DAO.
